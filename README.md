# Forcasting Fall 23
This repository is used to showcase my Forecasting class work inside of my master's program. This repository will feature word documnets showcasing my understand of certain items inside the code. I also presented jupyter notebooks that has the code itself. Hopefully, you will enjoy looking at my work. 

Week 04 Coding Exercise and Forecasting 
- During the week of 04, we wanted to understand time series better. We use time series data from the FRED Economic data to conduct some the work.
- We learned about rolling averages, shifting time, Simple forecast methods, and moving averages
- We were tasked with doing a coding exercise to help with our understanding of the material.

Week 05 Coding Exercise and Forecasting 
- In this section we were taksed with understand Time Series Decomposition and Decomposition based forecast
- We used data that was given to use and data from FRED Economic data

Week 06 Coding Excercise and Forecasting 
- In this section we wanted to use different types of methods provided in python
- We used the statsmodels packages to conduct our forecasting and understand we can use each model

Week 07 Coding Excercise and Forecasting 
- In this section we aimed to understand regression assumptions.
- We used python to create simple regression models that focuses on sales data

 Week 08 Coding Excercise and Forecasting 
- This section focuses on regression assumpation again but, we use rolling averages and the forecasting methods like AutoReg, NaiveForecasting to conduct our forecasting.
- This will be one section notebook

Week 9 Coding and Forecasting
Assigment 3 
- This section focused on the use of the forecasting methods ARIMA, decomposition, and adfuller
- This section will also feature Assigment 3 that takes the last 3 notebooks into account to create a forecasting project
