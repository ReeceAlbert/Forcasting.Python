This repository is used to showcase my Forecasting work inside of my master's program

Week 04 Coding Exercise and Forecasting 
- During the week of 04, we wanted to understand time series better. We use time series data from the FRED Economic data to conduct some the work.
- We learned about rolling averages, shifting time, Simple forecast methods, and moving averages
- We were tasked with doing a coding exercise to help with our understanding of the material.
